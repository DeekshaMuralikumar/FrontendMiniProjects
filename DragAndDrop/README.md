The Concept:
The system acts like a parking lot for information. You can move "cars" (cards) into "open spots" (empty slots), but you cannot park a car where one is already sitting.

Drag: Click and hold any card to "pick it up."
Drop: Release the mouse over an empty slot to move the content there.
Blocked: If you try to drop a card onto another occupied card, the move is ignored.

Features:
Smart Validation: The system automatically checks if a slot is available before allowing a drop.
Visual Feedback: Cards change opacity when grabbed, and targets glow when hovered over.
Automatic Cleanup: Once a card moves, the old spot automatically transforms into a dashed "empty" slot, ready for a new card.

States:
The Draggable Card: The item currently in motion.
The Active Target: An empty slot that is currently being hovered over.
The Empty Slot: A placeholder designed to receive new content.
